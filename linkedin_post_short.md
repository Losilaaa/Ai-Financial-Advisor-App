# 🚀 Just Completed My Capstone: Built a Production Multi-Agent AI Financial Platform

Excited to share **Alex** - a complete enterprise-grade SaaS platform I built for the "AI in Production" course!

## What I Built

A multi-agent AI system that provides personalized financial planning:
- **5 specialized AI agents** working in orchestration (Planner, Tagger, Reporter, Charter, Retirement)
- **Autonomous Researcher** that continuously gathers market intelligence
- **Full-stack application** with NextJS frontend and serverless AWS backend

## Key Achievements

✅ **90% cost reduction** - Implemented S3 Vectors instead of OpenSearch (~$30/month vs ~$300)
✅ **Multi-agent orchestration** - Deployed 5 agents using OpenAI Agents SDK with AWS Bedrock
✅ **Production-ready** - Security, monitoring, guardrails, and observability (LangFuse)
✅ **Serverless architecture** - Lambda, Aurora Serverless v2, App Runner, SQS, API Gateway, CloudFront

## Tech Stack

- **AI**: OpenAI Agents SDK, AWS Bedrock (Nova Pro), SageMaker Serverless
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, AWS Serverless (Lambda, Aurora, SQS)
- **Frontend**: NextJS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Clerk Auth
- **Backend**: FastAPI on Lambda, PostgreSQL with Data API

## What I Learned

- Deploying production AI systems at scale
- Multi-agent system design and orchestration
- Cost optimization in cloud environments
- Enterprise practices: security, monitoring, guardrails, explainability

The platform handles portfolio analysis, retirement projections, market research, and generates comprehensive financial reports—all powered by collaborating AI agents.
